# Game of Life
A muck around take on Conways Game of Life.

Project Specification:

The intention of this project is to create a visualisation of a version of Conway's Game of Life modified as described below.

Original rules of Conways Game of Life:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4.


New rules
1.
2.
3.
4.

The new rules function to complicate the game of life, by increasing the complexity from binary (alive or dead) to a system which incorporates the concepts of wealth and lifespan. I do not know whether or not the rules are good ones, or if the system will collapse quickly.

The code must be written using C++.

For data visualisation the terminal will be used. At a later date some form of web hosting may be used.
